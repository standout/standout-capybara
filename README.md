# Standout Capybara

The purpose of this gem is to make it easier to setup Capybara drivers with sane defaults. It will default to `headless_chrome`, and if you use it with nanobox it will default to `nanobox_chrome`. But feel free to overwrite the environment variable CAPYBARA to use another capybara driver.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development, :test do
  gem "capybara"
  gem "standout-capybara", require: false
end

# test_helper.rb, spec_helper.rb or rails_helper.rb etc
require 'capybara/rails'
require 'standout/capybara/setup'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Headless chrome

Just run your test command, the `headless_chrome` is the default driver


### Chrome

Run the test command with `CAPYBARA=chrome`.

Example:

```bash
$ CAPYBARA=chrome rake
```

### Nanobox chrome

Add a local only component of standalone chrome to your `boxfile.yml`

```yml
data.chrome:
  image: selenium/standalone-chrome
  local_only: true
```

Now you can run the test as usual.

Example:

```bash
$ nanobox run rake
```

### Options

Options that you can override using environment variables.

| Environment variable | Description |
|:-----------------|:------------|
| `CAPYBARA`  | Override the driver |
| `CAPYBARA_WAIT_TIME`  | Override default wait time of capybara |


### Available drivers

Override the driver using the environment variable `CAPYBARA`.

Example:

```bash
CAPYBARA=[driver name] test-command
```

| Driver name      | Description |
|:-----------------|:------------|
| chrome           | Regular chrome driver that will use a visual browser window. |
| headless_chrome  | Headless chrome driver. The default driver. |
| nanobox_chrome   | Default driver when inside Nanobox. |
| remote_chrome    | Default driver when `ENV['HUB_URL']` is defined. |

## Development

`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
